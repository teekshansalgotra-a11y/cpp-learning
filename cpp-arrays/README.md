# 📘 C++ Arrays – Basics & Practice

This repository contains my C++ array learning journey.  
It is divided into two folders:

- **basics/** → Simple programs + common array operations  
- **practice/** → Problems I solve daily/weekly (continuously updated)

## 📘 Basics Folder – Topics Covered

The **basics** folder includes:

- Array declaration & initialization  
- Traversing arrays  
- Finding largest element  
- Finding smallest element  
- Summing elements  
- Reversing an array  
- Linear search  

Each concept is implemented in a simple, clean `.cpp` file.
