📘 C++ Strings – Basics & Practice

This folder contains all my C++ string learning material.
It is divided into two parts:

basics/ → Important string concepts & fundamental programs

practice/ → Extra problems I solve regularly to improve logic and mastery

This structure helps in learning step-by-step while also showcasing consistent progress on GitHub.

🧠 Basics – Topics Covered

The basics/ folder includes simple, clean C++ programs:

🔹 1. String Input & Output

Using cin, getline()

Reading full sentences

🔹 2. Length of String

length()

size()

🔹 3. Traversing

Looping through characters

Using char

🔹 4. Concatenation and Compare

Adding strings using +

🔹 5. String Reversal

Swapping characters

Two-pointer logic

All programs are written in simple C++ for easy understanding.

📝 Practice Folder

The practice/ folder contains questions I solve to strengthen my understanding of strings.
I will keep adding more problems such as:

Palindrome check

Removing spaces

Counting words

Character frequency

Longest substring logic

LeetCode-style string problems

This folder will grow as I continue improving.
